# InferStatsR-Sampling-DataFrames

## Project Overview
This project explores fundamental R programming and statistical concepts, focusing on data frame manipulation, vector calculations, and sampling methods. Key concepts covered include calculating sample means, standard deviations, and standard error for population inference.

## Contents
The main code file includes:
- **Variable Manipulation**: Demonstrates variable class identification, typecasting, and basic array operations.
- **Data Frame Creation**: Creates a sample BMI data frame with gender, height, weight, and age columns.
- **Vector Operations**: Showcases vector arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Statistical Sampling**: Reads a dataset (`L1.csv`), calculates population mean and standard deviation, samples from the data to compute sample means, and estimates standard error.

## Key Concepts
- **Data Frames**: Introduction to handling structured data in R.
- **Sampling and Estimation**: Emphasis on generating sample statistics to infer population characteristics.
- **Vector Operations**: Basic and complex operations on R vectors, including arithmetic and logical comparisons.

## Requirements
- **R Programming Language**
